I learned how to navigate the Jenkins dashboard and identify core components like the build queue and job status. I created a simple pipeline with multiple stages and successfully ran it while monitoring logs in real time. Adding a new stage helped me understand how Jenkins reflects changes in the pipeline visualization. Overall, this gave me hands-on experience with Jenkins automation basics.
